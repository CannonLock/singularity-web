Our goal is to provide all Singularity users with the best possible assistance regarding any issue that might affect the security of their systems. </p>\n          <p>\n              Some of the biggest HPC centers on the planet depend on Singularity containers every day to run mission-critical applications. As stewards of the open source Singularity project, HPCng owes it to the community to establish a clear security procedure for the times when vulnerabilities are reported or discovered.\n              HPCng has delegated this responsibility to a few of us from the Singularity community who are collectively known as the Singularity Security team, and this web page documents the security policy we follow.\n          </p>\n          <h3><b>Do you think you found a vulnerability?</b></h3>\n          <p>\n              It's easy to assume that your software is secure, but we continuously test the current open source version of Singularity for vulnerabilities.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n              If you believe <strong>you have discovered a vulnerability</strong> in Singularity, let us know so we can research it!

Vulnerabilities are documented using the Common\n                  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system to provide a permanent\n                  searchable record allowing administrators to accurately judge the\n                  risks of running a particular version of Singularity within their\n                  environment.\n              </li>\n          </ul>\n          <ul>\n              <li>\n                  <strong><b>Enable stakeholders over malicious actors: </b></strong>\n                  When a new vulnerability is publicly announced, a race begins between\n                  system administrators and those with nefarious intent. HPCng\n                  partners that distribute Singularity only in binary form are provided security patches prior to security\n                  announcements.  They then distribute patched binaries to their stakeholders as a head start in the security race. Although\n                  patched binaries are made available to Singularity stakeholders first, they\n                  are provided without releasing security-related information.\n                  This limits exposure to the open source community while still\n                  providing a way of remediation for Singularity stakeholders, with a\n                  level of proactive measure.\n              </li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3><b>Singularity vulnerability procedure</b></h3>\n          <p>\n              When a vulnerability is discovered, the Singularity Security team takes the following\n              steps:\n          </p>\n          <ol>\n              <li>\n                  Perform due diligence to fully replicate and describe the scope and\n                  severity of the bug.

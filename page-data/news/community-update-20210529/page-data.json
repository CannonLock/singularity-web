Please join us in thanking Sylabs™ for all of the support they have shown the Singularity project over the years. We are looking forward to seeing where they take their fork and wish them the best.</p>\n<p>This change in organization affects the community project in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In an effort to bring awareness to the commercially supported Singularity options, Sylabs was the primary host for the Singularity website as well as documentation. This means we've had to create the community site and documentation pages, which is what you see here.</li>\n<li>We were lucky to have David Trudgian dedicated as the project's release manager. With the fork, David resigned this position, and luckily the founding organization of Singularity, Berkeley Lab, has stepped up. From this point forward, Krishna Muriki will be the official Singularity project's release manager. Thank you Krishna!</li>\n<li>Sylabs also was the security escalation vehicle for the Singularity project. We've now moved this role back into the community and Dave Dykstra from Fermi National Lab has stepped up to lead the project's security intiative. Thank you Dave!</li>\n<li>Nomcenclature is important! This is the official Singularity project. Forks that retain the same name cause confusion as versions, security implications, updates, and even meetings will all get confused. Sylabs is retaining \"Singularity\" as a product name, but have added suffixes to differentiate themselves, so please pay attention to nomenclature to ensure you are using the official Singularity project.</li>\n<li>HPCng, a community led by people from organizations like: AMD, ARM, Intel, Dell, DOE, and CIQ, is taking an active role in the further development and investment into Singularity, Warewulf, and standards around the next generation of High Performance Commputing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Short term you will see the GA release of Singularity 3.8.0 and stay tuned for more announcements around meetings, events, and subprojects!</p>\n<p>Thank you,\nGregory Kurtzer on behalf of the entire Singularity team.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 29, 2021","slug":"/news/community-update-20210529","title":"Community Update (May 2021)!"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"72eb1720-b42e-51dd-8ae0-4881fb5ea8da","frontmatter__slug":"/news/community-update-20210529","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"news"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}

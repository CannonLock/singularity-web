As many of you in this community have since pointed out, forking an open source project does not serve the community. While this situation is unfortunate, it is allowed by the Singularity license. However, there has been one major resounding request from the community: for Sylabs to rebrand their fork so as to not cause massive confusion as the projects drift apart.
